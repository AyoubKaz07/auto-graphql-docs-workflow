## USAGE
- Make sure you have a setup similar to this
- You can modify the github workflow in ```.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml``` (ex: choose what branch to trigger the workflow ...etc)
- Obviously ensure that your schema is correct
- This requires NOT using the `gql` template literal for schema definition (which i think its package is deprecated)
look [Example](./graphql/typeDefs/Entity1.ts)
